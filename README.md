# Sam's Comp20 Git Repo
1.	The purpose of this Git repository is to show all of the work I've completed as a student in Comp20, Web Development.

2.	My favorite assignment was probably assignment 2, because it was my first time using an API (Google Maps), and creating my own GET requests. I feel like that assignment was when I really began to understand how the web works, and how requests are sent.

3.	Being in Comp20 was important for my growth as a programmer because it was the first course where requirements were ambiguous (usually on purpose), and there was never only one right way to do something. I felt like this course most closely represented what it's really like to be a programmer; lots of googling, asking for help, and most importantly, asking for help.

4.	The most important thing I learned in this course is to give yourself enough time to screw up. The labs/assignments I started the day they were due were the ones that hurt me the most (see assignment 3). Messing up is an important part of the process, and often when you start too late, you miss that entire stage of the learning process.

5.	Now that I've finished the course, I want to make my own personal website to show off to employers (and my mom)

6.	Thanks to all the TA's, classmates, and Ming for all the help along the way!
